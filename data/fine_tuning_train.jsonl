It allows for flexibility but I think its a bad idea for it to be the main way. \n.\nI propose we have a method that lets the developer pass in the comment data and the kernel posts the comment on behalf of the plugin. \n.\nThe important part is that the comment has special metadata, a run ID, that includes the Cloudflare KV run UUID.  \n.\nAnd when other plugins in the chain want to leave a comment, it appends in its own divided section (using the plugin ID) \nThe kernel can have a custom parser that can manipulate the comment per plugin section (or \"field\") with the help of the metadata. \n.\nThe plugin developers are abstracted away from these low level details, and instead just have to worry about passing strings to the kernel to do the heavy lifting with. \n.\nThe primary method should have appending behavior, but we should also support clobbering (replacing the comment content, limited to only the section/field controlled by the plugin)\n.\nA simplified example of a section separator:\n```\n<!-- uuid@plugin name -->\n```\n```\n<!-- abcdef123456@ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-conversation-rewards -->\n```\nThe parser can identify section separators with a regex and parse out each plugin's output.\n\n### Issue Details\nRepository: ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel\nIssue Number: #154\nTime to Complete: Not completed\n\n### Valid Time Labels\nTime: <15 Minutes\nTime: <1 Day\nTime: <1 Week\nTime: <1 Month\nTime: <1 Hour\nTime: <2 Hours\nTime: <4 Hours"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Time: <1 Day"}]}

It could be especially useful when computing against larger tasks in the weeks or months range.  \n\nIt would be great to generate custom time labels for added precision. For example, if historical task A took an hour and task B took two hours, and a new task falls in the middle in terms of similarity, it could assign a label of 1.5 hours. We technically could do the same for priority levels, and get precise pricing generated. \n\nI would imagine that the more data the system has the more accurate these labels will be.\n\n### Issue Details\nRepository: ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing\nIssue Number: #71\nTime to Complete: Not completed\n\n### Valid Time Labels\nTime: <15 Minutes\nTime: <1 Day\nTime: <1 Week\nTime: <1 Month\nTime: <1 Hour\nTime: <2 Hours\nTime: <4 Hours"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Time: <1 Day"}]}

There's many clear examples of the task not being the right fit for the assignee and they try i.e. for months on projects that should be doable in a day.\r\n\r\nWe could consider doing limits on time limit \"top ups.\" So for example:\r\n```\r\nPriority 1 - 5 top ups\r\nPriority 2 - 4 top ups \r\nPriority 3 - 3 top ups \r\nPriority 4 - 2 top ups \r\nPriority 5 - 1 top up. \r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect that priority 5 tasks will border on eliminating most even capable assignees but once the task is complete even if just slightly after deadline we can always retroactively assign credit. \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- We should be able to toggle this behavior in the config. \r\n- If it is enabled the message should clearly explain the amount of remaining top ups. \r\n\r\nI foresee a bit of complexity around the logic related to dealing with the \"time limits\" for follow up/disqualify and the top up counter. \r\n- If the limits are 7/14 as they are now, then the first top up should occur after 14 days on a priority 1 normal project. \r\n- priority 5 top up would be after `14 / 5 = 2.8` days.\r\n- Check the assignment timestamp and use that as a point of reference to calculate the current top up counter/state. i.e. if the task was assigned 35 days ago, and the clock speed is 14 days, then `35/14=2.5` meaning we are still at top up number 2. \r\n\r\n## Example Context\r\n- https://github.com/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/46#issuecomment-2450630585\r\n- Assigned 1 November, but this should have been disqualified by 10 November. \r\n\r\nLogic: \r\n```\r\n14 days base timer / priority 4 = 3.5 days. \r\nthis means that top up counter increments every 3.5 days. \r\npriority 4 has 2 additional top ups. \r\n\r\n1 November is the original granted 3.5 day time limit. \r\nafter 3.5 days pass, the first top up is spent. \r\nafter another 3.5 days pass, the second top up is spent. \r\n\r\n3.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 = 10.5 days has elapsed \r\n\r\non the next attempt to follow up disqualification occurs because no more top ups remain. \r\n```\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n\r\nI wonder if the original time that we grant should be based on the `Time: ` label because I see problems with tasks that are set to `Time: <1 Week` and `Priority: 5 (Emergency)` they would only be able to get 5.6 days to work on it. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Issue Details\nRepository: ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-disqualifier\nIssue Number: #51\nTime to Complete: Not completed\n\n### Valid Time Labels\nTime: <15 Minutes\nTime: <1 Day\nTime: <1 Week\nTime: <1 Month\nTime: <1 Hour\nTime: <2 Hours\nTime: <4 Hours"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Time: <1 Day"}]}

I realized that the scoring is implemented incorrectly. The primary crediting strategy is supposed to be based on the amount of elements. The word counter is a separate scoring mechanism. This was added as an after thought in version one, but it seems that you prioritized word count over element count. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that the original emphasis on element count allows us to easily target and credit special and useful elements such as `<a>`, `<img>`, and `<code>`. Helpful comments generally have links, images and code samples. \r\n\r\n- With the following example, I would expect only one `<p>`\r\n- The comment word count is `7`\r\n- We also need the ability to ignore words inside of specific tags. For example, `<code>` \r\n\r\nNow you are keeping track of word count PER element which is more complex than it needs to be. Remember, the word count scoring strategy was added as an after thought for version one. Version one simply counts all the words in the comment (but also ignores words in specific elements, like `code`.) at the end of all the complex calculations.\r\n\r\nAside from the ignore capability, it doesn't care which element contains the words. \r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 2014495969,\r\n  \"content\": \"Wouldn't solve scenarios requiring keys or credentials\",\r\n  \"url\": \"https://github.com/ubiquity/cloudflare-deploy-action/issues/6#issuecomment-2014495969\",\r\n  \"type\": \"ISSUE_ASSIGNEE\",\r\n  \"score\": {\r\n    \"formatting\": {\r\n      \"content\": {\r\n        \"p\": {\r\n          \"count\": 7, // should be changed to `wordCount` and you should correctly count the amount of `p` tags to be `elementCount`\r\n          \"score\": 1\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"wordValue\": 0,\r\n      \"formattingMultiplier\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    \"reward\": 0,\r\n    \"relevance\": 0.3\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- I would expect our `p` scoring to be `0` but our word scoring to be `0.1` for a grand total of `0.7`. \r\n- Because this is the assignee writing on the issue (not the pull) we can provide credit; so the multiplier should not be `0`. \r\n- Perhaps we could do a 4x multiplier, which yields `2.8` but then multiply by relevance to yield a sum of `0.84` for the comment.\r\n\r\n[Source](https://github.com/ubiquibot/conversation-rewards/actions/runs/10474375714/job/29008494818#step:7:527) \n\n### Issue Details\nRepository: ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-conversation-rewards\nIssue Number: #92\nTime to Complete: 2 months\n\n### Valid Time Labels\nTime: <15 Minutes\nTime: <1 Day\nTime: <1 Week\nTime: <1 Month\nTime: <1 Hour\nTime: <2 Hours\nTime: <4 Hours"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Time: <1 Day"}]}
